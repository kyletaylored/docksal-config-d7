# Docksal Config: Drupal 7

This is a basic automated config when using Docksal and Drupal 7.

## Instructions

1. Review and override the `docksal-local.env` and `docksal-local.yml` files as they require project specific variables.
2. Update any global variables as this is usually shared with your team. i.e `SITE_PATH`
3. Run `fin init`

```bash
fin init
```
